- Does your time fly away and you have no idea where?
- Do you have a need to track time in several different ways at the same time?
- Have you tried other time trackers and think they are too cumbersome to use?

Timepolice will let you track time in a very flexible way, with high granularity
and with a minimum of interactions.

The workflow is simple:

1. Define templates with lists of tasks to pick from.
2. Create sessions from templates.
3. As you do different things, swipe between active sessions and mark each switch of task with a simple touch.
4. Export tracking data for use in a spreadsheet like Numbers or Excel.

What makes Timepolice different from other time trackers?
- You can track time according to several different temlplates at the same time.
- Switching task requires only one touch on the screen.
- All task switches are easy to edit later.
- Templates (in the form of text files) and tracking data (in the form of spreadsheets) are easy
to administrate with standard office tools.
